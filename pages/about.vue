      <p>
        I am originally from Georgia, but most recently lived in Utah before moving to Dallas, Texas. Growing up I always loved learning about new things, especially in regards to technology. It all began many years ago when my parents brought home a commodore 64 computer (oh how far we've come!).

        That love of learning persisted, and I’ve spent much of my life pursuing knowledge. I attended Utah Valley University where I received my Associates of Science. In pursuit of my bachelors degree I took many classes in life sciences, chemistry, and geology before discovering computer science. After several semesters in the CS program I felt like college was actually hindering my learning of modern web development. As a result I decided to attend DevMountain's full stack web development program and I’ve never looked back!

        Now I work for DevMountain as a full stack web developer and lead mentor. I’m living the dream by not only continuing my learning, but also through helping others learn and grow into successful web developers.
